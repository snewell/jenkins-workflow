# Jenkins Common Library
This is a collection of scripts used for a personal [Jenkins][1] server.  They
are built primarily around my needs/desires in Jenkins but the goal is to keep
them at least somewhat generic.

## Installing
Push this repository to your Jenkins's [Pipeline Global Library][2].  Once
that's done you're free to start using these scripts in your pipeline jobs.
