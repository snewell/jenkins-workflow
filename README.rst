Jenkins Common Library
======================
This is a collection of scripts used for a personal Jenkins_ server.  They
are built primarily around my needs/desires in Jenkins but the goal is to keep
them at least somewhat generic.


Installing
----------
Push this repository to your Jenkins's `Pipeline Global Library`_.  Once
that's done you're free to start using these scripts in your pipeline jobs.
